# For a while

Iterate we must
To prevent repetition
Say and say again
Do and do again
Again and again
# I thought you said prevent?

For every number between 0 to 1:
  display again
> again

Only once? I asked for 2 agains
Neither Python nor Anaconda yield an answer
I'm no snake charmer

# Let me see what I get
For every number between 0 to 1:
  display number
> 0

Ah ha! Never the last number
I return, confident

For every number between 0 to 2:
  display again
> again again

Blue hoodies explain
"exclusive and inclusive"
like social circles
"upper and lower bounds"
like income inequality

Running in circles
The struggles don't seem to end
What do we call that?

While I'm alive:
  try again
